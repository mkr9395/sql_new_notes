    "**1. Question:** Explain the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses in SQL. When would you use each?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - `WHERE` filters rows *before* aggregation, operating on individual rows.\n",
    "   - `HAVING` filters rows *after* aggregation, operating on grouped rows.\n",
    "   - Use `WHERE` for row-level conditions and `HAVING` for conditions based on aggregated values (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Question:** Describe the purpose of window functions in SQL and provide an example using `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing them into a single output row.\n",
    "   - Example (using `DENSE_RANK()`):\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT product_id, sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sales DESC) AS sales_rank\n",
    "     FROM sales_table;\n",

    "**3. Question:** How do you optimize a slow-running SQL query? List at least three techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are created on frequently queried columns.\n",
    "   - **Query Rewriting:** Avoid `SELECT *`, use specific column names, and minimize subqueries.\n",
    "   - **Avoid Correlated Subqueries:** Replace them with `JOIN` operations or window functions.\n",
    "   - **Partitioning:** Partition large tables to improve query performance on subsets of data.\n",
    "   - **Execution plan analysis:** Use `EXPLAIN` to understand how the query is being executed and identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Question:** Explain the concept of a \"common table expression\" (CTE) and provide a use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - A CTE is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.\n",
    "   - Use case: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, more readable parts or recursive queries.\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     WITH MonthlySales AS (\n",
    "         SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(sales) AS total_sales\n",

    "\n",
    "**5. Question:** What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - `UNION` removes duplicate rows from the combined result set.\n",
    "   - `UNION ALL` includes all rows, including duplicates.\n",
    "   - `UNION ALL` is generally faster because it doesn't perform duplicate elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Question:** How would you handle missing values (NULLs) in a SQL query?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - Use `COALESCE()` or `IFNULL()` to replace NULLs with default values.\n",
    "   - Use `CASE` statements to perform conditional logic based on NULL values.\n",
    "   - Filter out NULLs using `WHERE column IS NOT NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Question:** Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows where there's a match in both tables.\n",
    "   - `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table (NULLs for unmatched rows).\n",
    "   - `RIGHT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table (NULLs for unmatched rows).\n",
    "   - `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows when there's a match in either table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Question:** Describe how to implement a recursive query in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - Use a CTE with a `UNION ALL` clause, where the CTE references itself.\n",
    "   - This is useful for hierarchical data like organizational structures or bill-of-materials.\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (\n",
    "         SELECT employee_id, manager_id, employee_name, 0 AS level\n",

    "   - ACID properties:\n",
    "     - Atomicity: All or nothing.\n",
    "     - Consistency: Maintains database integrity.\n",

    "     - Durability: Changes are permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Question:** How do you create and manage database indexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - `CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);`\n",
    "   - Use `DROP INDEX` to remove indexes.\n",
    "   - Monitor index usage and performance to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Question:** Describe the use of `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in SQL.\n",

    "\n",
    "**13. Question:** How do you handle large datasets in SQL for analytical purposes?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - A correlated subquery references a column from the outer query. It executes once for each row processed by the outer query.\n",
    "   - Regular subqueries execute once and produce a result set used by the outer query.\n",
    "   - Scenario: Finding employees whose salary is higher than the average salary of their department.\n",

    "**2. Question:** Explain the concept of \"query hints\" and when you might use them. What are the potential drawbacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "   - Query hints are directives to the database optimizer, influencing execution plans (e.g., index usage, join order).\n",
    "   - Use when the optimizer's choice is suboptimal.\n",
    "   - Drawbacks: Can make queries less portable, dependent on specific database versions, and potentially hinder future optimizations.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.**  \n",
    "   - `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.  \n",
    "   - `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; unmatched rows in the right table are null.  \n",
    "   - `RIGHT JOIN`: Opposite of `LEFT JOIN`.  \n",
    "   - `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows from both tables, with nulls for unmatched rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are primary keys and foreign keys?**  \n",
